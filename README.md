# WOPi

## **W**ildlife **O**bservation **Pi**

WOPi is a software bundle to turn your Raspberry Pi into a multi-purpose wildlife observation platform.
> Raspberry Pi is a trademark of the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

##Features##
* Make use of the Raspberry Pi camera module to upload a picture to the web in a predefined interval
* attach one or more (DS1820) temperature sensors to your pi and collect their data
* convenient browser based web administration instead of CLI

Use your **WOPi** to:
* watch what's going on in the birdbox in your garden (my current use case)
* remotely observe your aquarium 
* check on the stats of your lizard's terrarium
* install a wildlife cam somewhere else
* ...

I want everybody to be able to realize a wildlife observation project without the need of having to dive into the depths of the technical realization - including having to administer the Pi via CLI over an ssh connection to install and configure the necessary software. This is how WOPi came to be. One install script is everything a "non-technical" user should have to invoke to have a fully running Wildlife Observation Platform.

Check back soon to see the progress.
